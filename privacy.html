<p class="CDt4Ke zfr3Q" dir="ltr">You can request an account deletion in ALUVA LIVE settings at any time.

Additionally, we will retain your personal data even after you have closed your account if reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations (including law enforcement requests), meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, maintain security, prevent fraud and abuse, or enforce the Terms of Service. We will retain de-personalized information after your account has been closed.</p>
<p class="CDt4Ke zfr3Q" dir="ltr">Since ALUVA LIVE will be used in multiple jurisdictions and we may not be possible to identify all the inconsistency between certain terms of this Privacy Policy and the applicable law in your jurisdiction, thus you agree to notify us once such inconsistency is identified by you. Under this circumstance we will take necessary methods to eliminate such inconsistency, including deleting these personal information improperly collected or used by us.</p>
