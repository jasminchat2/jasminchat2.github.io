<p>In your&nbsp; profile, just click on&nbsp;&nbsp;next to your current location and either enter a new one or select one from the dropdown menu.</p>
<p>If you cannot see the&nbsp;&nbsp;when trying to change your location it is because of one of these reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are using the mobile app and the website at the same time and therefore your location will be automatically detected by the GPS of your mobile device and cannot be changed.</li>
<li>You don't use the app and your browser's location services are not providing us with accurate coordinates. Simply disable location services on your browser and you can then manually set your location on your profile.</li>
</ul>
<p>Contact our&nbsp;<a href="mailto:jasminchat@protonmail.com">Customer Care Team</a>&nbsp;if you have issues with your location when using the mobile app.</p>

<p>First thing&rsquo;s first: welcome back!</p>
<p>If you deleted your profile less than 30 days ago, you should have a confirmation email from us that includes a reactivation link. Click that and you&rsquo;ll be able to jump right back in.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s been longer, you&rsquo;ll need to create a new profile &ndash; a good excuse to switch things up and try a different approach, maybe?</p>
