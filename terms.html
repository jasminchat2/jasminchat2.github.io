<p>We may specify in certain of our ALUVA service-specific terms that you are contracting with one of our affiliate companies or Service Providers (instead of us) in relation to your use of the relevant ALUVA service or feature to which the relevant service-specific terms apply.

<p>We may change the Minimum Age from time to time based on our sole discretion.

<p>&ldquo;Minimum Age&rdquo; means 18 years old. However, if applicable law requires that you must be older in order to lawfully use ALUVA without parental consent (including using of your personal data) then the Minimum Age is such older age.</p>
