Although we have tried our best to strip the legalese from the Terms, there are places where these Terms may still read like a traditional contract. There&apos;s a good reason for that: These Terms do indeed form a legally binding contract between you and HARATEAMS. So please read them carefully.<br>&nbsp; By using the Services, you agree to the Terms. Of course, if you don&apos;t agree with them, then don&apos;t use the Services.<br>&nbsp;The following Terms of Service outline your obligations when using our mobile application (&ldquo;App&rdquo;) or Service (as defined herein), or any of the information, text, graphics, videos, or other files, materials, data or content of any kind whatsoever created or provided by or through the<br>&nbsp;App or the Service or through your ability to sell products on the App and generate User Contributed Content (as defined herein). Please also review our Privacy Policy, which is a part of these Terms of Service and which outlines our practices towards handling any personal information that you may provide to us.<br>&nbsp; The App and the Service are owned and operated by HARATEAMS.

This license is for the limited purpose of operating, developing, providing, promoting, and improving the Services and researching and developing new ones.<br>&nbsp; Because Local is inherently public and chronicle matters of public interest, the license you grant us for content submitted to those Services is broader.
